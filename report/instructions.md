GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE REPORT

You can pick any topic for the project you wish so long as there is some direct connection to reinforcement learning. For your project, you can implement an RL solution, or you can think about a theoretical problem or algorithm, or you can do a blend of both. 

Writing a final report
The end result of your project should be a written report clearly and concisely describing what you did, what results you got, and what the results mean. Your report should be 4-6 pages long. If necessary, you can include further details or plots/figures in at most 5-page appendix. The report should use 11pt font, 1-inch margins, and single spacing. Papers that vary from these guidelines risk receiving a grade deduction and/or some sections not being read.

Your report should follow the general format of a scholarly paper in this area. You should write your report as clearly as possible in a manner that would be understandable to a fellow student of this course. In other words, you should not assume that the reader has a background beyond what has been covered in class (as well as the prerequisites of the course).

Your report should begin by describing the problem you are studying, some background (what has been done before), and the motivation for the problem, i.e., why it is worth studying. Previous work and outside sources should be cited throughout your report in a scholarly fashion following the style of academic papers in this area.

Next, you should clearly explain what you did, both from a high level and then in more detail. For an experimental paper, you should explain the experiments in enough detail that there is a reasonable possibility that a motivated reader would be able to replicate them. You also should outline some of the theory underlying the algorithms you are studying. State your results clearly, and think about graphical tools you can use to make your results clearer (a table of numbers is usually less compelling than a graphical representation of the same data). Look through published papers for ideas. For a theoretical paper, the model and other mathematical details should be explained well enough for the results to be stated with mathematical precision and clarity.

In every case, be sure to explain the meaning of your results. Don’t just give a table of results or a dry mathematical formula. Explain what the results mean, and what conclusions can be drawn from them. Again, do all this in a way that would be understandable and interesting to a fellow student of this course. What did you expect to find? What did you find instead? What are the implications? If you found something surprising, can you think of how it might be explained?

What you will be graded on: Projects will be graded along the following dimensions:

originality and creativity
background material
theoretical component and/or experimental design and execution
discussion and interpretation of results
writing of the final report, including clarity, completeness, and conciseness
overall effort

Section 3.1.3 - Tables 1 & 2 (Dense and Sparse Rewards)

Current issue: Two separate tables with excessive column width for "Design Rationale"
Recommendation: Combine into single compact table with abbreviated rationale codes (expand in footnotes)
Space saved: ~40% reduction, approximately 8-10 lines

Section 4.3 - Action Distribution Data

Current issue: Two separate lists (percentages, then counts) presented as bullet points
Recommendation: Single compact table with 3 columns: Action | Percentage | Mean Count/Episode
Space saved: ~50% reduction, approximately 6-8 lines

Section A.1.2 & A.1.4 - Tables 6 & 7 (State/Action Space)

Current issue: Wide tables with verbose descriptions
Recommendation: Compress Table 6 by using abbreviations (e.g., "Tgt Rel Pos" instead of "Target Relative Position"), move detailed descriptions to caption or footnote. For Table 7, merge "Constraints" into a compact code system
Space saved: ~30% per table, approximately 8-10 lines total

Section 3.1.5 - Iterative Calibration Problems

Current issue: Narrative format with repetitive structure across 3+ problems
Recommendation: Convert to structured table with columns: Problem | Observed Behavior | Root Cause | Fix | Result
Space saved: ~35% reduction, approximately 12-15 lines

Section 4.1 - Training Metrics List

Current issue: Bullet-pointed list of 7 training metrics with ranges
Recommendation: Convert to compact 2-column table: Metric | Value (Range)
Space saved: ~25% reduction, approximately 4-5 lines

Section 5.1 - RLHF Integration Approaches

Current issue: 4 numbered approaches in narrative paragraph format
Recommendation: Convert to comparison table with columns: Approach | Key Steps | Human Time | Training Time | Pros/Cons
Space saved: ~20% reduction while improving readability, approximately 8-10 lines

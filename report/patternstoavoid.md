Formatting: you must avoid sentence patterns like this:
[X] extends beyond [Y]: [subject] should not only [Z] but [W]
[Statement A], [gerund phrase], [Statement B]
[Statement A] rather than purely/merely [Statement B]
Rather than [A], we [B]: [details], while [C]
[Subject] enables [noun/noun phrase] and [verb phrase with similar meaning]

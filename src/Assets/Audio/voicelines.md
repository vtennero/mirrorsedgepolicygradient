**SUCCESS - GOOD TIME**

Clean. Efficient. That's how we stay ahead of the blues in this city.
Celeste would be proud of that one. Fast and focused.
The city's rhythm - I'm feeling it now. That's the flow.
That's positive reinforcement right there. The city rewards speed, and so do I.
Optimal policy achieved. Or maybe I've just been running these rooftops too long.
Fast convergence. That's what Icarus would call it if he stopped talking in riddles.

**SUCCESS - GENERAL**

Made it. Not my best, but the runners don't stop moving.
Target reached. Still got work to do before I'm back to form.
Another rooftop crossed. The city keeps testing us, we keep moving.
Episode complete. Reward collected. Sometimes I sound like Mercury's tech babble.
The algorithm's simple: move fast, don't fall, don't get caught. Still learning the parameters.
Another iteration done. The runners don't get infinite rollouts - gotta make each one count.

**SUCCESS - WITH STYLE**

Unnecessary flip? Maybe. But if the blues are watching, might as well give them a show.
Flow isn't just about speed - sometimes it's about reminding yourself why you run. And that felt good.
Celeste always said style points don't matter. She was probably right. But damn, that was clean.
High reward for that flip. My policy might be overfit for style, but the city needs beauty too.
Exploration versus exploitation - I chose style. The blues didn't catch me, so the reward's valid.
Unnecessary action, positive reward. My loss function needs work.

**FELL**

Ground's hard. Good thing this is practice. Mercury would've laughed at that one.
Lost the line. The city doesn't forgive mistakes like that - lucky this is training.
Faith, you're better than this. Reset. The runners need me sharp.
Negative reward. Time to update my policy before the city gives me a real penalty.
Catastrophic failure. Good thing I can reset - the blues don't give you that option.
Poor state-action value there. Mercury always said I needed more training data.

**FELL - AFTER STYLISH ATTEMPT**

Okay, maybe the backflip wasn't necessary. The city wants efficiency, not ego.
Show-off move, rookie mistake. Celeste was right - focus on the run, not the flair.
Over-explored that action space. The city's reward structure is clear: survive first, style second.
My reward shaping needs adjustment. Backflips don't help when you're face-down on concrete.

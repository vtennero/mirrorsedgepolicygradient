    # - Target distance: 300 units (was 105)
    # - Platform count: 20 (was 8)
    # - Episode timeout: 90s (was 30s)
    # - Agent spawn height: 1.25 (fixed to prevent falling through platform)
    # - Platform height randomization enabled (similar to horizontal gap randomization)
    # - Heights vary between -1.5 to +2.5 units per platform, within absolute bounds of -0.5 to 5.0 units

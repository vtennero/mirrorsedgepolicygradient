    # Test v21: Sprint + longer platforms + dynamic target
    # - Action space: 4 actions (0=idle, 1=jump, 2=jog, 3=sprint)
    # - Observation space: 14 floats (added stamina)
    # - Stamina: 100 max, 33.33/sec consumption, 5 per jump, 20/sec regen
    # - Platform length: 24 units (doubled from 12)
    # - Target position: Calculated dynamically from last platform + offset
    # - Platform count: 20
    # - Episode timeout: 90s
# engine_settings section removed - use run_inference.py wrapper script for inference
# or pass --time-scale parameter directly for training
